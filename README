       路 --dd, ----ddeebbuugg

         this option, the more ppggsshhaarrkk will be verbose.

       路 --pp, ----pplluuggiinn

         Select the traffic processing plugin. See section "PLUGINS".

PPLLUUGGIINNSS
       There's only one plugin available presently. A lot more should come
       though (proxy, denormalizedSQL, report, ...).

       路 ssqqll

         The ssqqll plugin write captured queries on stdout. Because of
         limitation of SQL language it doesn't support unnamed prepared
         statement, so it actually name them.

         Presently, this plugin doesn't support cursors.
