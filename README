PLUGINS
    * sql

      The sql plugin write captured queries on stdout. Because of limitation
      of SQL language it doesn't support unnamed prepared statement, so it
      actually name them.

      Presently, this plugin doesn't support cursors.

    * normalize

      The normalize will try to normalize queries and prepared queries and
      output them to stdoud. It aims to give you a list of unique queries,
      however the number of time they has been send by clients and whatever
      their parameters were.
